# 🚴‍♂️ Virtual Courier Simulator

---

## 📦 About
This project is a **console-based courier simulation**.  
🎮 The player controls the courier, represented by a red **K**, using the arrow keys **(⬆️⬇️➡️⬅️)**.  
🗺️ On a 10x10 grid, **5 customer addresses** are randomly placed.  
📍 When the courier reaches a customer address:
- The customer list at the top updates with ✅ **“Package delivered”**.  
- A log entry `Courier reached the address, package delivered.` is added to the `cost.txt` file.
